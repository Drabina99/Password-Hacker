# Password Hacker

The program connects to a server and tries to break into it by taking advantage of vulnerabilities, such as:

- using weak passwords - in this case a brute force may be enough to guess it
- using popular logins and passwords - this is where a "dictionary-based" brute force comes in
- time-based vulnerability: for example, when an exception is caught, the server's response is much longer, which means we are on the right track to guess the password

This is a JetBrains Academy project - more information on it is available here: https://hyperskill.org/projects/80
